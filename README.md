"May This Email Never Find You"

Premise:

You are a burned out software developer, sick of the modern world. 
You receive word that your grandfather has passed, and has left you a property in a remote village at the edge of the Alaskan wilderness on the coast.
You start off with a minimal set of basic gear and set out to build your homestead, earning your living from the land.



Gameplay:
	The purpose of the game is to survive and expand your homestead, gaining skills and new gear to help you survive and thrive in your new wildnerness home
	You start off with a set of basic gear:
		- Single-shot break-barrel shotgun
		- Medium-action Fishing Rod
		- Axe
		- Hand Saw
		- Kayak
		

Gear:
	- There should be progression for each type of gear that provides quality of life improvement or unlocks new abilities
		- e.g. 
			- player starts off with a single-shot break-action shotgun. Shotgun enables them to hunt duck / geese. Buying a rifle enables them to hunt deer 
			- Player starts off with hand-axe and saw. Buying a chainsaw allows them do harvest larger trees faster, buying as mill allows them to mill their own lumber
	- Different tiers of tools enable either make easier or enable new activities
		e.g. a handaxe lets you fall small trees and split firewood, but a chainsaw is needed to fall larger trees and mill lumber
		
	+ Categories:
		+ Guns: Guns are for hunting and self-defense from wolves and bears
			- Shotguns:		
				- Progression: single-barrel, double-barrel, pump, auto
				- Ammo: slug, buck, bird-shot
			
			- Rifles: 
				- Progression: single shot, bolt action, level action, semi-auto
				- Small, medium, and large calibre - influences what you can hunt (e.g. squirrel vs deer vs bear)
				
			- Pistol: mainly for defense, but can be used to hunt. Players may be attacked by wolves or bears, so should always carry a fire-arm
				.10mm semi-auto, .357 magnum
				
		+ Woodcutting:
			Basic tier: Axe, handsaw
			Advanced tier: chainsaw 
				- Chainsaws can be expanded with different bar sizes to allow cutting larger trees
				- Mill can be added to allow player to cut lumber to build with
				
		+ Boats:
			Players need a skiff to get around to different areas, go fishing, and haul items like wood or meat
			- Skiffs:
				multiple tiers - mainly influences speed and weight capacity
			- Fishing boats
				allows players to fish with nets or trawl with multiple lines
	
	
	

Economy:

	- Items and resources can be gained by collecting them from the environment, trading for them with neighbors, buying them from a local trading outpost.
	
	- Trading: neighbors in the community are willing to trade extra items (in limited quantities) with you for things they need, or perform services
		- E.g. a neighbor will mill a log into lumber for you, but takes some of the lumber in exchange
		
		- What neighbors have to trade / will accept is limited to specific items and usually smaller (randomized) quantities.
		- e.g. your neighbor might have 2 boxes of shotgun shells, or a 15 pieces of fish bait, and is willing to accept firewood in trade.
			- what they will accept in trade may depend on their profession (e.g. a fur trapper might have extra traps and accept pelts to barter)
			
	- Trade Outpost:
		- This is main place for purchasing items and upgrading gear
		- Your community has a local trading outpost
			- They stock basic gear like:
				- gasoline for chainsaw
				- diesel for boat
				- ammunition for hunting
				- food
				- misc hardware (nails for building? need to think through)
				
			- Gear like boats, guns, tools can be ordered via catalog or purchased at the trading outpost
				- As players skill level increases, new items are unlocked (e.g. goes from out-of-stock to available)
				
	
Mechanics:
	+ Dangers to player: 
		The wilderness is unforgiving. Players can starve, freeze to death, be thrown from a boat, killed by falling trees, or mauled / eaten by dangerous animals in the forest.
	
	+ The primarily loop of the game is collecting resources to build / craft with / sell
	
	
	+ Economy:
		Players can craft or harvest many items, but some items must be purchased (e.g. guns, boats, chainsaws, fuel)
		Players should strive to harvest or craft sellable items to gain money to purchase these things (e.g. selling pelts from hunted animals or selling high-value fish)
	
	+ Food:
		Players must harvest meat or fish and prepare them in order not to starve.
			- Fresh meat/fish can be cooked on the stove and eaten, but spoils if not preserved
			
		- Preserving food:
			- Food can be preserved with the right equipment
			- Fresh meat / fish have limited shelf-life before spoiling
			 	Player can construct a smoker
			 		Smoked items last weeks
			 	Player can purchase (or craft) a canner
			 		canned items last indefinitely
			 	
	+ Temperature:
		Players heat their house by burning wood. Being too cold results in health damage, so players must have firewood ready to keep their stove burning
		
	+ Construction:
		Players can construct structures (walls, fences, doors) to build bases. Building requires things like nails (traded for or purchased), and lumber which the player can
		harvest by downing trees and milling them with a chainsaw
		
		Players can build outbuildings, smokers etc.
	
	+ Hunting:
		Hunting involves some degree of skill or challenge. E.g. player must go to the correct area, and should have to walk slowly to avoid making noise / startling game
		Hunting skill reduces animals awareness of player
	
	
		Game animals:
			Bears
			Deer
			Ducks
			Geese
			Wolves
			Rabbits
		
	+ Logging:
		Players can collect wood from downed trees in the forest, or logs on the beach. As their skills grow and equipment improves, they can cut down trees to harvest them.
		Quality and amount of wood will vary depending on source. Falling trees are dangerous and can harm player.
